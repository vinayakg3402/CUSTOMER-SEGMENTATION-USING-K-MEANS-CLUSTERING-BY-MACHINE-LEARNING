# CUSTOMER-SEGMENTATION-USING-K-MEANS-CLUSTERING-BY-MACHINE-LEARNING
Title: Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Description:
This repository contains code and resources for performing customer segmentation using K-Means clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Customer segmentation is a crucial task in marketing and business analytics that involves dividing customers into groups based on their similarities, preferences, and behaviors.
In this project, we leverage K-Means clustering to automatically identify distinct groups of customers based on features such as purchasing behavior, demographic information, and interaction patterns. The repository includes:
	Data Preprocessing: Code for cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for clustering analysis.
	K-Means Clustering: Implementation of the K-Means algorithm to partition customers into clusters.
	Evaluation Metrics: Calculation of clustering evaluation metrics such as silhouette score or inertia to determine the optimal number of clusters.
	Visualization: Visualizations of the clustered customer groups using plots such as scatter plots, dendrograms, or silhouette plots.
	Interpretation and Insights: Analysis and interpretation of the resulting clusters to extract meaningful insights about different customer segments.
	Documentation: Detailed documentation explaining the code structure, usage instructions, and insights derived from the analysis.
By utilizing this repository, users can gain insights into their customer base, identify target audiences, tailor marketing strategies, and improve customer satisfaction and retention.
Feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or use this project as a basis for your own customer segmentation tasks. Happy clustering!
